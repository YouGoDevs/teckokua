## A Mission for Diversity

Everyone deserves a fair chance at a better tomorrow. Especially so for those starting in tech that from underrepresented communities. Part of our core mission will be to help elevate voices and the skills of those at a disadvantage in an unfair system.

## Kokua

From [shelivesaloha](https://www.shelivesaloha.com/blog/2019/hawaiian-word-of-the-week-kokua): 

> Kokua [koh-ku-ah] is an important concept in Hawaiian culture. It means “help,” but it goes deeper than that. Kokua is about helping others without expecting anything in return. In a world where we’re juggling so many demands and going about our day at full speed, it’s easy to lose sight of the needs of others.
